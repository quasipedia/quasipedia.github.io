                <p>I have been on and off keeping a blog well before the term was coined.  My
on-line presence started with hand-written <span class="caps">HTML</span> using_notepad for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0">windows 3.0</a><em>, then <span class="caps">HTML</span> 2.0 came out and I start experimenting with
</em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoTMetaL">HoTMetaL</a><em> and </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotDog">HotDog</a><em> (among the first <span class="caps">HTML</span> editors on the market).
Then it came </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">GeoCities</a><em>, and when I got my fist domain I started using 
dynamic sites, using </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type">Movable Type</a><em> at first, then </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">WordPress</a><em> and
later on </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal">Drupal</a>_.</p>
<p>But if there is one thing that all this technological wandering taught me, is
that I seldom if ever use dynamic features on my sites: the only facility
important to me is the possibility to generate feeds and tag pages
automatically.  Besides, a dynamic sites means more maintenance, and more
hosting&nbsp;costs.</p>
<h2>Go&nbsp;static</h2>
<p>So, this time around I started looking for some simple and lean tool, that
would generate static pages that I could push up to some repository server
(like <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> or <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>), without having to worry about server
maintenance and security patches.&nbsp;Ever.</p>
<p>Given the rise of GitHub to a prominent actor in this kind of solutions, I 
obviously started my quest by looking into <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jeckyll</a> and to the very nice
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.  No doubt these are very excellent solutions, but - at least
for me - they have two major&nbsp;drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are based on ruby, which is a language that completely fails to
    intrigue me (don&#8217;t take this as a judgement on the language in itself,
    though: it&#8217;s just my personal&nbsp;taste!).</li>
<li>To leverage the integration with GitHub to its best, you should have the
    <em>source</em> of your site available on a GitHub repository (and the free
    account on GitHub only allows for public&nbsp;repository).</li>
</ul>
<p>I would have rather chosen a <strong>python-based</strong> solution, provided it would have
been <strong>actively maintained</strong>, and supporting the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown syntax</a></strong>.<br />
Documentation too had to be extensive and well&nbsp;organised.</p>
<h2>Meet&nbsp;Pelican</h2>
<p>Lo and behold, after having considered a few alternatives, I settled for
<strong><a href="http://docs.getpelican.com">Pelican</a></strong> of which - I must confess - I never heard&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The underlying technologies are <strong>python</strong>, <strong>markdown</strong> and <strong>jinja2</strong>.
    The best of the breed, at least for&nbsp;me.</li>
<li><strong>Stable</strong>, and adopted widely enough to have its little community of
    contributors (and themes, and&nbsp;plugins&#8230;)</li>
<li>Very <strong>well documented</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: the last commit was days before I started working on this&nbsp;project.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible organisation</strong> of your source&nbsp;files.</li>
<li><strong>Small but sensible set of feature</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cons (or at least the few glitches that I have met so&nbsp;far):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poor support for Python3</strong> (according to the documentation it should have
    worked out-of-the-box, but in reality it did not work at all for&nbsp;me).</li>
<li><strong>Compulsory use of categories</strong>: these are internal to the logic of
    Pelican, beside the possibility to use tags. In a perfect world, I would
    have very much preferred to have an abstract taxonomy that could represent
    both categories and&nbsp;tags.</li>
<li><strong>Non-intuitive naming convention</strong>: for example, the file holding the
    configuration used in development is called <code>pelicanconf.py</code>, while the
    one use for producing the &#8220;deployable&#8221; pages is called <code>publishconf.py</code>.
    (I would have considered <code>devel-conf.py</code> and <code>prod-conf.py</code> more apt
    names). But also the makefile targets: <code>devserver</code> is the target to start
    the server, but <code>stopserver</code> is the one for stopping&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><strong>Helpers are half-backed and inconsistent</strong>. For one, there are a couple
    of Makefiles and shell scripts tossed around for no good reason: a python
    script would have resulted in much simpler and cleaner code. Besides,
    scripts like <code>pelican-quickstart</code> offers support on certain areas where
    one probably would feel safe to do stuff manually (pushing the site live),
    but misses out on important ones like installing extra themes or&nbsp;plugins.</li>
<li>There are <strong>very few good themes</strong>, and the few that look nice are not&nbsp;responsive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>For those interested in trying out a similar setup to mine, here&#8217;s a breakdown
of my directory&nbsp;layout:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>.                            [1]
├── content
│   ├── extra                [2]
│   ├── images
│   └── pages
├── develop_server.sh
├── Makefile
├── output                   [3]
├── pelicanconf.py
├── pelicanconf.pyc
├── plugins                  [4a]
├── publishconf.py
├── publishconf.pyc
└── themes                   [4b]
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li><code>[1]</code>: This is the main repository (in my case a private&nbsp;repository)</li>
<li><code>[2]</code>: Certain files, like <code>robot.txt</code> needs to be copied verbatim every
    time the site is generated. I stored such files here and used the
    <code>FILES_TO_COPY</code> setting to make pelican aware of&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><code>[3]</code>: This is the directory where the static pages are generated. I set
    this to be an ignored directory for the main repo at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0">1</a> and within it
    I cloned my github pages repo (i.e.: the repo, to which I have to push
    every time I want to to publish a new version of the site). See below for
    more&nbsp;details.</li>
<li><code>[4]</code>: Both of these directories are git &#8220;submodules&#8221;, linked to the themes
    and plugins repositories. In other words: these are &#8220;sub-repositories&#8221;. See
    below for more&nbsp;details.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Git&nbsp;magic</h2>
<p>It took me a couple of attempts before getting this right, but this is the 
key two concept to keep in mind in the above&nbsp;configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>When invoking a git command, git will progressively look &#8220;one directory up&#8221;
    until it will find a valid repository (a <code>.git</code> directory). So, <strong>it is
    possible to nest Git repositories</strong> and treat them independently, but one
    will have to:<ul>
<li>Tell the container repo to ignore the directory where the contained one&nbsp;lives.</li>
<li>Move to the contained repo every time a command need to be issued for
  that specific repository.
Essentially, the two repository will not even be aware of the existence of
the other&nbsp;one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Submodules are a different story</strong>: the repositories marked as submodules
    are known to their container. In fact, commits in the main repository 
    contain information on what commit is checked out in each submodule.
    This is very convenient, as - given a master repository called <code>foobar</code>,
    one can issue <code>g clone --recursive foobar</code> and all submodules will be
    checked out correctly, too. You can read more on submodules <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
